Mainline
========

Mainline is a rails plugin which exposes your rails app via webrick to allow
testing with browser automators such as Selenium or Watir. Mainline allows
your rails actions to run in the same transaction as your unit tests so you
can use fixtures, factories, or whatever.

Currently mainline only supports one integration session at a time.

Just install it to use it.
